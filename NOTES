REACT => main two parts
 1. React-dom => Web developement
 2. React-native => Mobile application developement

 In vite react we have to name the file with .jsx extension and also we have to make first word of file capitalize like Meet.jsx

 also while making a function in the Meet.jsx we have to name our function first word capital and then we have to export default that function.
in that function we have to return an html element.

we have to import that element in another file and then we have to use only one element in that file.
